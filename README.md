peewee4cosmo is a backend database that supports the monitoring efforts of the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) team at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, MD. This project was based off of the COS Monitoring (COSMO) project that was created by Justin Ely. Like COSMO, peewee4cosmo uses a MySQL database server with a object-relational mapper (ORM) Peewee instead of SQL Alchemy. The aim of this project is to provide the COS team and community with updated monitoring data, track detector trends, and have the most up-to-date resources available to extend the lifetime of COS.
